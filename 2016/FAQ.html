<!--<blockquote><p>"This is my first OSWD Template"</p></blockquote> 
<p>That's me right there. I really needed a new design for my own site, and I came up with this. The picture of the tree is in fact mine, taken in Penticton, BC.
</p>
<p>I tried my best to keep it as simple as possible. The logo on the top-left hand corner is a white-on-alpha PNG that can be replaced with your own logo. I made mine on a tilt so it fits nicely on on the hill there. </p>
<p>The digg bar there can easily be linked up to an RSS parser like I do on my site. (I have a script to do that, <a href="http://jole.ahtr.net/">let me know</a> if you'd like it.)</p>
<p>It <em>is</em> fully fluid, the main content area will resize to fit just about any screen. The header banner does crap out after 1280px, because otherwise load time would be terrible.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>By all means, use it whichever way you want. I have learned CSS/XHTML thanks to the wonderful designers on OSWD, and maybe my design will help you!</p>
<p>I go by the CC Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike, so all I ask is you keep the comment in the header of the page in there so people know who made the original.</p>
<p>Also, if you do use my template, I'd love to see it in action! Email me @ <a href="mailto:jole@ahtr.net">jole@ahtr.net</a>. </p>
<p>That's about it! Enjoy!</p> -->
