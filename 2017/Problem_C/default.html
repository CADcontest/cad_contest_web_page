<a name="RESULTS">
<h2 class="auto-style5">I. INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p class="auto-style2" align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The multi-deck standard cell placement legalization problem has become more challenging because of complicated design rules and design utilization at 14nm and lower technology nodes. An ideal legalization method should remove all overlaps while satisfying delicate and complicated design rules with preserving the quality of the given placement provided by global placement or timing optimization steps. In other words, during the legalization step, not only the average cell movement but also maximum cell movement should be minimized. In addition, the process must be fast and robust to handle the sheer number of cells in the state-of-the-art designs. Some of the challenges in legalization of designs with advanced nodes are as the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Routability gap before and after legalization</b>: In addition to wirelength, the quality of routability is optimized during the global placement. However, in legalization the routability is degraded as the initial solution provided by global placement is perturbed. This issue has become more critical in advanced node technologies because of a high average number of pins per net (usually 4 or more), data-path modules in the netlist, accounting for special requirements associated with clock networks, accounting for timing objectives, etc.s</li>
        <li><b>Physical floorplan complexity</b>: These challenges stem from overall placement utilization, fence regions, irregular shape of the placeable area (e.g., disproportionate floorplan aspect ratios, rectilinear macro shapes, and narrow channels between large macros), boundary-pin-placement restrictions, power/ground routing resource estimation, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Complicated design rules</b>: In addition to the constraints and rules defined to address the complexity of physical floorplan, there are other complicated design rules to address detailed routability. Some of these rules are: EDGETYPE spacing constraints among cells, and pin access and pin shorts issues [1,2].</li>
        <li><b>Target utilization</b>: Most legalizers do not consider target utilization effectively. This can exacerbate situations where an input placement has local regions with high cell area utilizations. In such a scenario, it is not easy to achieve the desired timing characteristics since there may not be enough whitespace in those areas to effectively apply buffer insertion or gate sizing techniques to meet timing requirements.</li>
        <li><b>Multi-deck cells</b>: With shrinking transistors, an increasing number of multi-deck cells occupying multiple rows(e.g. multi-bit registers) are used in advanced node technologies to achieve low power and high performance. However, it is hard to handle multi-deck cells during legalization. Legalizers should not only satisfy all the traditional constraints defined, but also the P/G alignment when placing multi-deck cells. There are some recent works trying to address Multi-deck cell legalization [3, 4].</li>
    </ul>
<p class="auto-style2" align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditional academic legalizers have mainly addressed removing overlaps among cells on each standard row defined in the design. However, in practice there are growing challenges (including those mentioned above). Hence, new approaches are needed to overcome these challenges.</p>

<h2 class="auto-style5">II. Benchmark Suite</h2>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will provide a benchmark suite using the Library Exchange Format (LEF) and Design Exchange format (DEF) 5.8 exchange format for this contest. You can find complete descriptions of these standard ASCII formats at <a href="http://www.si2.org/openeda.si2.org/projects/lefdef">http://www.si2.org/openeda.si2.org/projects/lefdef</a>. For each design, we will provide four files:
    </p>
    <ul type="square">
        <li><b>Cells.lef</b> - Physical characteristics of the technology library for the standard cell library, macros, and IO cells, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Tech.lef</b> - Physical characteristics of the routing layers, vias, placement site types, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Design.def</b> - Design-specific logical and physical information that represent of the design during any stage of the physical design process. This includes net-list connectivity, grouping information, physical constraints, cell locations and orientations, routing geometry data, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Design.constraints</b> - A text file that includes some others constraints such as maximum target utilization or maximum displacement. Any constraint defined in this file is considered as a soft constraint. If each of the constraints defined in this file is not satisfied, a penalty will be enforced for the evaluation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will provide a sample benchmark suite by February 30, 2017, to help you iron out parsing the data and initially test your infrastructure. We will provide one benchmark suite with 8 designs driven from the ISPD 2015 benchmarks by March 30, 2017. Both will be downloadable from the ICCAD 2017 contest website. The global placements of all designed are generated by Eh?Placer [5]. The released benchmarks and some hidden benchmarks will be used to evaluate the final binaries submitted by team participants.
    </p>
    <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LEF/DEF parsers:</h3>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We strongly encourage downloading the LEF/DEF parsers already available from <a href="http://www.si2.org/openeda.si2.org/projects/lefdef">http://www.si2.org/openeda.si2.org/projects/lefdef</a>. If you do not have an SI2 license, please contact your university staff to obtain a free license for academic use. You may also write your own LEF/DEF parsers if you wish. However, using the already available parsers will save you a considerable amount of effort and time. Since the recommended parsers are not provided by the contest organizers, the contest organizers are not responsible for any issue with the referred link or the source codes.</p>

<h2 class="auto-style5">III. Evaluation Metrics</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is the list of evaluation metrics: </p>
    <ul type="square">
        <li><b>Maximum Cell Movement</b> is computed based on maximum Manhattan distance of cells from their original positions divided by the height of a placement row..</li>
        <li><b>Average Cell Movement</b> is the total Manhattan distance of movable cells divided by the number of movable cells and the height of a placement row.</li>
        <li><b>HPWL</b> is computed for each solution.</li>
        <li><b>Target Utilization:</b> standard deviation from average placement utilization provided for each design.</li>
        <li><b>Runtime</b> directly affects the evaluation of each team. However, there is a specified maximum runtime target. Multi-thread implementations are strongly encouraged. The maximum number of threads allowed to run in parallel is 8.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exact evaluation metric will be published on the website with the release of the final benchmark suite. Redhat-6.0 executables will need to be provided for this evaluation. In addition, there will be additional “blind” testing of the final executables for each team on a similar set of unseen benchmark designs. The solutions generated by each team will be evaluated by Mentor Graphics’ Olympus-SoC P&R tool [6].</p>
    
<hr>
    
<!--------------------------------------------------------------->    
    
<h2 class="auto-style5">IV. Constraints</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following are the constraints considered for the contest: </p>
    <ul type="square">
        <li><b>Soft Constraints:</b> Target utilization, maximum cell movement cell edge spacing, pin access and pin shorts are considered as soft constraints. If each of these constraints is not satisfied, a penalty will be enforced for the evaluation. The definitions of penalties are presented later.</li>
        <li><b>Hard Constraints:</b> P/G alignment of multi-deck cells, row and site alignments, and fence regions are defined as hard constraints. Each solution must satisfy these constraints; otherwise, the submission receives the maximum score.</li>
        <li><b>Netlist Constraints:</b> The cells in the netlist must remain the same. That is, no cell resizing, no addition/deletion of buffers, tech remapping, etc. are allowed; however, <b>cell flipping is allowed as long as no hard constraint is violated.</b></li>
        <li>Each submitted binary is allowed to use up to 8 parallel threads per run. Any thread in addition to 8 parallel threads is terminated, which may lead to unexpected results.</li>
    </ul>
<hr>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------->

<h2 class="auto-style5">VII. Evaluation Score</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a given solution, Mentor Graphics Olympus-SoC is used to resolve detailed routing issues including cell edge spacing, pin access, or pin shorts problems. If the solutions provided by participants correctly satisfy detailed routing constraints, no perturbation will be applied by Olympus-SoC.</p>

<h2 class="auto-style5">XIV.  FAQ</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>I would like to ask why "cell flipping is allowed only for cells with height equal to odd numbers of a row height."<br>
            <font color="red">When there are cells with height equal to odd numbers of a row height, they can be placed on any row by using cell flipping to align them with P/G. However, cell flipping does not help cells with height equal to even numbers of a row height to be aligned with P/G and they cannot be placed on any row.
            There are two types of cells with height equal to even numbers of a row height. One type has only pins vss on the top and bottom of a cell while the other type has pins vdd on the top and bottom of a cell. The first type can be placed on only even rows while the second type can be placed on only odd rows. Since cells flipping doesn't help here, it is no allowed for cells with height equal to even numbers of a row height.

        <li>According to the instruction in the website of the contest, we click the link:”  https://projects.si2.org/openeda.si2.org/projects/lefdef/”. Then, we want to download LEF/DEF parsers file and use it. So, we register a Guest-Individual account because we are still students in the school and we don’t have company name. However, when we press the button (circle with the red line in the following picture1) in the website, it comes out the other website (picture2) and the file doesn’t show up.<br>

        <li>
            In the description of Problem C, ‘Contest Procedure’3-a) Read the LEF/DEF/Verilog input files. However, uploaded sample benchmarks only contain LEF/DEF and constraint files. For my opinion, DEF file contain net information. So, even without verilog file, I can construct circuit. As a result, my question is, which one is right input file format? ( Uploaded sample or description - verilog included )<br>
            <font color="red">
            All required information including cell interconnections is provided in the DEF files. We might remove the statement regarding Verilog files from the description.
            </font>
        </li>
        <li>
            LEF and DEF file contain various metal and via information. Should we consider routability or Metal via location for contest result(result.def)?
            <font color="red">
            Improving routability or timing is not the objective of this contest. However, the participants should consider power grid (P/G) mesh provided in the def files to align cells with rows. We encourage reading reference [3] for P/G alignment issues. In addition, there are some detailed routing rules such as edge spacing, pin access, and pin shorts constraints that should be satisfied in the solutions provided by the participants. In references [1] and [2], these issues are introduced. In reference [5], some methods are proposed to address the mentioned problems during the legalization.

        </li>
        <li>
            Is there any starter_kit for using LEF/DEF parser? I download LEF/DEF parsers source code from si2.org. But It’s really complicate for using. If contest don’t care metal via or routability, I’d like to make own parser only for placement.
            <font color="red">
            The participants can write their own parsers. However, the parsers should be compatible with LEF/DEf version 5.8 or above.

            In pci_bridge32_a_md1 folder, we have a problem with the placed.def file. The placed cell like this below locates on (289415 -1000). Why some cells are out of the chip?<br>
            <img src="image/fq6.png" width="480px"><br>
            Are the cells out of chip supposed to be legalized?<br>

            We are contestants of problem C and we found the in all of the released test cases, there is no POWER or GROUND rail for the bottom of first row and top of last row defined in SPECIALNETS of placed.def. I was wondering if these two rows are allowed to place cells?<br>
            <font color="red">Yes, cells are allowed to be placed on those rows as long as no P/G alignment is violated. For example, if a double row height cell is placed on the first row, its vdd/vss pins must be aligned with the power/ground rail on the top of the first row and the power/ground rails on the second row.</font>

        <li>
            Can you explain what are pin access and pin shorts in more detail?
            <font color="red">Pin shorts occur where fixed objects (including power/ground rails and primary inputs/outputs (PIOs)) overlap cell pins (not including vss/vdd pins) on the same metal layer. Pin access issues occur where cell pins (not including vss/vdd pins) overlap with fixed objects on a different metal layer. In addition to cells overlapping with fixed objects, highly congested areas have the potential of pin shorts and pin access problems during the detailed routing step (for more information please refer to reference [5]). Since the main objective of problem C does not include improving detailed-routability, contestants should consider only those pin access/shorts problems that may be caused by fixed objects.</font>

            I have a further question on the latest `def` toolkit def_5.8-p023 recommended by the contest. At line 374 of function<br> `defrInitSession`function in defrReader.cpp of def_5.8-p023, it should be<br>
            > if (defContext.session == NULL) {<br>
            instead of<br>
            > if (defContext.session = NULL) {<br>
            , which may keep `defContext.session` being null pointer. I reported this bug to SI2 as well.

            In test-cases edit_dist_1_md1 and fft_2_md2 provided in the benchmarks, the lef version of cell_modified.lef and tech.lef are inconsistent in each of the two cases (5.5 and 5.7, respectively) . Is it normal to have inconsistent version in the two lef files? (I got some parsing problems when they are inconsistent)<br>

            We have a question regarding the EDGETYPE constraint:<br>
            If we have the following constellation:<br>
            <pre>
         ____    ____<br>
         |    |  |    |<br>
         |    2  1    |<br>
         |___|  |___|<br>
            </pre>
            An EDGETYPE 2 on the right side of the first cell and an EDGETYPE 1 on the left side of the second cell. Does the rule "EDGETYPE 1 2 0.400" from the tech.file apply to this example, as well? We are asking this question because in our example we have the numbers "2  1" and the rules only specifies "1 2".<br>
            <font color="red">Yes, because for a pair of edge types, the edge spacing rules are symmetric.</font>
        </li>
        <li>
            Can you further explain the EDGETYPE spacing constraints? If EDGETYPEs are the property of the cells, in which cells are they defined?<br>
            <font color="red">
            The edge spacing table is defined in file "tech.lef". For example, the following statement is the table defined for design "fft_2_md2":<br><br>

            PROPERTYDEFINITIONS<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LAYER LEF57_SPACING STRING ;<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LAYER LEF57_MINSTEP STRING ;<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MACRO LEF58_EDGETYPE STRING ;<br><br>

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LIBRARY LEF58_CELLEDGESPACINGTABLE STRING<br>
            "CELLEDGESPACINGTABLE<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>EDGETYPE 1 2 0.400</b><br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>EDGETYPE 1 1 0.400</b><br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>EDGETYPE 2 2 0.000</b><br>
            ;" ;<br>
            END PROPERTYDEFINITIONS<br><br>

            For each cell, two properties are defined for the left and right edges in file "cells_modified.lef". For instance, the following statement is the properties defined for <b>MACRO ms00f80</b> of design "fft_2_md2":<br><br>

               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PROPERTY LEF58_EDGETYPE "<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDGETYPE <b>LEFT 2</b> ;<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDGETYPE <b>RIGHT 2</b> ;<br>
             " ;<br><br>

            For the above example, any cell <b>c2</b> instantiated from <b>MACRO ms00f80</b> has EDGETYPE <b>2</b> for the left and right edges. Therefore, if a cell <b>c1</b> with EDGETYPE <b>1</b> for its left edge is place just on the right side of cell c2, there must be a gap equal to 0.400 between two cells <b>c1</b> and <b>c2</b>.

            I think the violation in FAQ #8 is not well-defined. I was wondering whether only aligning power (ground) pin on ground (power) rail produces violation or even aligning power/ground pin on no rail produces violation as well?<br>
            <font color="red">The P/G alignment constraint must be satisfied where there are power (ground) rails. Placing cells on rows with no power (ground) rail does not violate any P/G alignment constraint.</font>

            In the hard constraint, we have to make sure every macro which must be placed in the regions where belong to some groups. But, there are some macros do not define its fence region, so we want to know whether it can be placed in any region?<br>
            <font color="red">If a cell is not assigned to a fence region, it must not be placed within a region; otherwise, the solution will not be acceptable. We strongly encourage the participants to refer to references [1] and [5].</font>

            In the constraint file, there is a maximum_movement constraint define the vertical displacement ex. 20 rows, but we don't know the constraint of horizontal displacement ex. x site. Therefore, Could we  ignore the horizontal displacement during the legalization?<br>
            <font color="red">The defined constraint is used for the maximum movement including both vertical and horizontal movements.  The maximum and average cell movements are computed based on the L1 distances of cells from their original locations. For a given design, if maximum_movement=20rows, the L1 distance of any cell c1 from its original location divided by the height of a row should not be greater than 20.</font>

            I was wondering in case `des_perf_b_md1` why the total area of cells named `h6a/*` `h6b/*` `h6c/*` was larger than the total area of regions belong to er6?<br>
            <font color="red">Thank you for bringing up this issue to our attention. We have resolved the issue and updated the benchmarks.

            In the updated benchmarks, there is no P/G rail on the bottom of first row and top of last row. Can it be guaranteed that there will and will only be lack of P/G rail on these two positions in the final as well as unseen benchmarks?<br>
            <font color="red">
                For rows defined in a design, two situations may happen:<br>
                1- If a row has a P/G rail, all cells located on that row must satisfy the P/G alignment constraint.<br>
                2- If a row does not have any P/G rail, there is no need for satisfying the P/G alignment constraint.<br>

            We can see from the `cells_modified.lef` file that all cells are allowed to flip by the x-axis as well as the y-axis. However, from FAQ #1, flipping even-row cells by the y-axis is not allowed because of no help on P/G constraints. Is it allowed to flip by the x-axis and/or the y-axis to help to minimise HPWL and to avoid pin access and pin shorts issues while not violating the P/G rules?<br>

            Looking in the DEF file for the fft_a_md3 circuit I noticed that some fixed blocks (for example, block h0) are not aligned to circuit rows and cells. Shouldn't they be aligned as well?<br>

            I’m a little confused on FAQ #18. Below is an example while light (dark) yellow lines are power rails (pins), light (dark) blue lines are ground rails (pins) and light grey lines are empty rails. I was wondering if cell E and I were legal while all others were illegal? <br>

For single row height cells, both row orientation rules and P/G alignment must be satisfied. If a row does not have any P/G rails, the orientations of the cells on that row must be the same as the orientation of the row. In other words, for standard cells with one row height, the orientations of cells on a row must be satisfied even though the row does not have any rails.</font>

            For FAQ #8, I can understand that P/G rails on metal 2/3 may affect the pin accessibility. However, as far as I'm concerned, influence by metal 4/5 may not be that large.

            <font color="Red">In the DEF file provided for each design, the information of P/G rails is presented by using statement SPECIALNETS.

            According to the Alpha test report, we found that the evaluation terms $S_{am}$ and $S_{mm}$ are calculated before resolving detailed routing issues by Olympus-SoC. I was wondering if the soft constraints (i.e., edge spacing, pin access and pin shorts) have any impact on score? If they do, which evaluation terms do they affect?<br>
             <font color="red">
                Thanks! You are right; we did not consider soft constraints for evaluating alpha submissions. But we will consider them for beta and final submissions. We have realized that applying the Mentor tool on the solutions may lead to some unexpected improvements in results; therefore we have decided to take into account violations for the soft constraints as a penalty function in the total score. The updated version of the evaluation scores will be announced by Aug. 10th.

           I was wondering if it was possible to release the corresponding def file generated by Olympus-SoC? I looked into region er4 of case des_perf_b_md1 but it seemed impossible for signal pins to avoid overlapping with P/G rails including those in metal 4 & 5. The boundaries of er4 are:<br>
            ( 272807 298000 ) ( 286607 372000 )<br>
            ( 286607 298000 ) ( 321207 314000 )<br>
            In term of sites, the boundaries are:<br>
            (1365 149) (1433 186)<br>
            (1433 149) (1606 157)<br>
            The total area is:<br>
            68 * 37 + 173 * 8 = 2516 + 1384 = 3900<br>
            There are two P/G rails in metal 4 across this region:<br>
            ( 282000 0 ) ( 286000 600000 )<br>
            ( 301900 0 ) ( 305900 600000 )<br>
            In term of sites, the boundaries of rails overlapping with the region are:<br>
            (1410 149) (1430 186)<br>
            (1510 149) (1529 157)<br>
            Since the width of the widest cells of this case is 8 and each cell has at least 1 signal pin, we can block the following region:<br>
            (1417 149) (1423 186)<br>
            (1517 149) (1522 157)<br>
            The blocked area is:<br>
            6 * 37 + 5 * 8 = 222 + 40 = 262<br>
            The total free area in this region is:<br>
            3900 - 262 = 3638<br>
            However, the total cell area in this region is: 3752, which is larger than total free area.<br>
            <font color="red">Thank you for bringing up this issue to our attention. We will investigate the issue; however, this issue imposes only a penalty value on the results driven from legal solutions. In other words, as long as the submitted solutions are legal, this issue does not affect the results of the participants because all submissions are evaluated using the same criteria. The Mentor tool does not apply any perturbation on the provided solution (no DEF file is generated).</font>
        </li>
        <li>
            In some benchmarks we encountered cells which have a global placement position within blockage areas or in regions other than the region they are assigned to. Thus in order to legalize great movements are necessary to get the cells out of the "forbidden area". These movements dominate the maximum movement and we wonder if they are included in the score calculation as any other cell or neglected.<br>
            <font color="red">All cells are taken into account.</font>
